### Cleaning up Timeouts, Intervals, and Events in JavaScript

This script is designed to clean up timeouts, intervals, and events when a parent component unmounts in a Vue 3 application using the Composition API.

### What Happens if Interval is Not Cleared?

If the interval is not cleared when the component unmounts, the interval will continue to run in the background. This can lead to:

- **Memory Leaks**: Since the interval keeps referencing the callback function, it prevents garbage collection, causing memory to be used unnecessarily.
- **Unnecessary Computations**: The interval will keep executing its code, leading to potential performance issues.
- **Unexpected Behavior**: If the interval interacts with the DOM or application state, it may cause errors or unexpected behavior after the component is no longer present.

### Important
This composable works great for single page components but it runs into issues when called from multiple locations at the same time
#### Im looking for a fix
